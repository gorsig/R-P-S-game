        <h2>JAPAN'S MOST DANGEROUS GAME: ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS</h2>
        <p>If you've ever needed help making a small decision like who gets the last piece of pizza or who gets to ride
            shotgun, you're probably more than familiar with the game of rock, paper, scissors.
            But you might not know how big rock, paper, scissors is in Japan. Turns out that rock, paper, scissors – or
            as it's known in Japan, janken – was big in Japan before anybody in the West had ever even heard of it.
            Like kanji, fireworks, and General Tsao's chicken1, rock, paper, scissors was actually created in China. The
            game was created around the time of Christ, but stayed in China for hundreds of years.
            It wasn't until the 1700s that it made its way over to Japan.

            The rest, as they say, is history.
